    # One attempted fix for the issue was to add a readinessProbe which would check if
    # the service is ready to accept traffic.
    # Note that this readinessProbe is executed inside the container.

    #   exec:
    #     command:
    #       - /bin/sh
    #       - -c
    #       - curl -f -s httpstat.us/200
